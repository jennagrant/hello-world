# hello-world
This repository is used to display the project my team and I completed for the final project of the semester in Database Management class at the University of Iowa.

## Project Title
**Database Management Final Project Spring 2023**

  
## Project Introduction
The NFL Draft took place last week, and previous datasets can help predict how a player will perform based on when they were drafted. The NFL Draft is important for NFL teams because it allows the teams to bring new talent and opportunities into their roster. For this project, our group gathered data from NFL Drafts between 2000 and 2015 in order to understand past patterns and trends of the NFL Draft. Our project will also analyze the most successful members of the drafts, and if the team they were drafted to has an impact on their success. This analysis can be helpful for NFL players, NFL teams, and football enthusiasts looking for more information about the draft. 

## Data Set Chosen for the project
The dataset we chose for our project was found on Kaggle.

## Within the project construction...
Our team used normalized the data into ERD's, used create table commands, created queries that answered relevant research questions pertaining to the data, and finally transferred this over to create a website application that created visuals and tables from our findings.

## Questions our Application Answered
1. What is the total number of draft picks made by each team between the years 2000 and 2015?
2. What is the number of games played by first round draft picks from 2000-2015?
